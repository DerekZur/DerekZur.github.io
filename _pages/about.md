Derek is from New York where he earned a B.S. in Geological Sciences from the University at Buffalo. His research interests revolve around fate and transport of contaminants in nature, distribution of trace metals in different environments, water quality and remediation practices, and soil redox chemistry. He is currently interested in wildfire dynamics and how contaminants can be mobilized post-fire. In his free time, he likes to climb, play guitar, and take photos.Â
